                <h2>Red fruits</h2>
                <p>
                    Red fruits range from small to large, averaging 10 to 30 centimeters in diameter and 30 to 120 centimeters in length, and vary in appearance depending on the variety. The fruits can appear long and narrow with an elongated, cylindrical shape, or they can be short with rounded, curved ends. The surface of the fruit’s skin is made up of tiny, tightly adhered sections that contain small seeds, giving the fruit a pebbled, firm, and bumpy appearance. The skin also matures from green to bright red, orange, or yellow, depending on the variety. Underneath the layer of individual sections, there is a spongy, semi-fibrous, white pulp. Red fruits have a rich, oily consistency, especially when cooked, and have a mild, sweet, and subtly medicinal flavor.

                <h2>Orange fruits</h2>
                <p>
                    The antioxidants in orange fruits that give them their color, beta-carotene, also maintains glowing skin, hair, and eyesight.Because most people’s diets are deficient in beta-carotene, it’s critical to include a few orange fruits on your plate every day. Citrus fruit’s yellow coloring isn’t high in beta-carotene, but it is high in another antioxidant, vitamin C, that also benefits fighting infection. Here are a few orange-colored fruits that you should try.

                <h2>Purple fruits</h2>
                <p>
                    Purple fruits and vegetables are rich in anthocyanins, which are natural plant pigments that provide foods with their unique color, registered dietitian Katherine Brooking writes for WebMD. Studies have shown that anthocyanins may benefit brain health, help to lower inflammation, and fight cancer and heart disease.
